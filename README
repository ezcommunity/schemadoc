Primary goal: documentation of the ez publish database schema
For this time, foreign keys will only be applied to the DB so that schemaSpy can generate 
the diagrams for the eZ Publish core database design and selected extensions.

Secondary goal: placeholder for creating foreign keys to existing schema.
The idea is to introduce foreign keys as a separate project
The foreign keys can be introduced to the bundled eZ Publish schema at a later point.
Potential purposes can be cascading deletes and concistency checks.


schemaSpy requires 

* java
* graphviz


To generate the schemaSpy diagrams

* Verify for db name username & password in generate_diagrams.sh or override with options.
* Run 'generate_diagrams.sh -a' (-h for help)


To re-generate the sql foreign keys (already in the sql folder)

* symlink the git clone from the ezpublish extension folder (no need to activate as an extension)
* 'php extension/schemadoc/php/autogenkeys.php' generates the sql (to standard out, no html formating) found in fkeys_generated.sql
* fkeys_manual.sql contains SQL foreign keys not handled by autogenkeys.php
