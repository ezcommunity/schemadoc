Initial placeholder for creating foreign keys to existing schema.
The idea is to introduce foreign keys as a separate project
The foreign keys can be applied to the eZ Publish schema at a later point.
For this time, it will only be applied to the DB so that schemaSpy can generate 
the diagrams for the eZ Publish core database design. Extensions may be added later.


schemaSpy requires 

* java
* graphviz


To generate the diagrams

* symlink the git clone from the ezpublish extension folder (no need to activate as an extension)
* 'php extension/db/php/autogenkeys.php' generates the sql (no html formating) found in fkeys_generated.sql
* fkeys_manual.sql contains SQL foreign keys not handled by autogenkeys.php
* Verify for db name username & password in generate_diagrams.sh
* Run generate_diagrams.sh
